# Backend Engineer - Technical Assessment
Our tech teams are curious, driven, intelligent, pragmatic, collaborative and open-minded and you should be too.

## Testing Goals
We are testing your ability to rapidly prototype an application underpinned by good software engineering practises that demonstrate the skills for backend project. You will need to use your intellect, creativity, judgement and be comfortable making decisions to produce a solution. Your solution does not need to be a complete applications but should demonstrate you understand how to build software with good software engineering practises.

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task but can as much or as little time as you deem necessary to demonstrate your understanding of the problem, your range of skills and approach to problem solving.

Some successful candidates have spent as little as 3 hours whilst others have used the full week because they've enjoyed exploring different ideas, technologies and approaches.

## The Task
You are required to build a prototype healthcare API that could be used to provide patients care record to a healthcare application.

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task and should focus on an MVP but you are free to take this as far as you wish.

## The Solution
Your MVP can use any of the following technologies along with **any frameworks, libraries you feel appropriate**:

- **API** - Python
- **DBs** - MySql / Postgres / SQLServer Express / Filesystem

You should containerise your application using docker / docker-compose. 

## Context
[FHIR](/https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) is a popular standard within healthcare used by healthcare systems to exchange data and represent details of paitents in a standardised way. Some sample FHIR data has been generated in the data directory using a tool called [synthea](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html). 

As FHIR is a standard there may be many libraries and UI widgets you can use freely. Google is your friend.

## Evaluation
We take into account 5 areas when evaluating a solution. Each criteria is evaluated from 0 (non-existent) to 5 (excellent) and your final score would be a simple average across all 5 areas. These are:

- Functionality: Is the solution correct? Does it run in a decent amount of time? How well thought and architected is the solution?
- Good Practices: Does the code follow standard practices for the language and framework used? Take into account reusability, names, function length, structure, how crendentials are handled, etc.
- Testing: Test design and coverage.
- Execution environment: Container, Virtual Environment, Dependency Management, Isolation, Ease of transition into a production environment etc.
- Documentation: How to install and run the solution? How to see and use the results? What is the architecture? Any next steps? 

## Submit your solution	
Create a public Github repository and push your solution including any documentation you feel necessary. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, please send us the URL to the repository.
